<u>Payroll and Tax forms</u>

Your payroll documentation will be available online through the University’s Employee Self-Service (ESS) at <%= set_link(

<u>Policies & Procedures</u>

You will also be subject to and bound by University policies of general application and their related guidelines. The policies are listed on the Governing Council website at <%= set_link("http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Governing_Council/Policies.htm")%>. For convenience, a partial list of policies, those applicable to all employees, and related guidelines can be found on the Human Resources and Equity website at <%= set_link("http://policies.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/")%>. Printed versions will be provided, upon request, through Human Resources or your supervisor.

You should pay particular attention to those policies which confirm the University’s commitment to, and your obligation to support, a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment as set out in the <i>Human Rights Code</i>, is safe as set out in the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, and that respects the University’s commitment to equity and to workplace civility.

All of the applicable policies may be amended and/or new policies may be introduced from time to time. When this happens, if notice is required you will be given notice as the University deems necessary and the amendments will become binding terms of your employment contract with the University.
